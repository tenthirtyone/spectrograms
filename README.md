So I was bored goofing around re-platforming and playing with Shopify and I made this.

I saw this Reddit post where someone was sampling every frame in some movies. They analyze the frame for a dominant color and then paint a line on canvas of that color. I thought that was interesting and wanted to try it myself.

I'm using Vibrant.js because they provide more sampling features than I could have put together in days, let alone a few hours. Also, my first attempts all came out different shades of green/brown.
